## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Archify diagram capability: nine typed MCP tools for local validation,
  rendering, delivery receipts, browser checks, comparisons, migrations, and
  brand references; the clean Docker seed now carries its pinned runtime for
  offline operation. Diagram-request detection (routing, recommendations, and
  acceptance criteria) is a single shared pattern that excludes database and
  API schema work. Delivery-receipt verification enforces the full showcase bar
  (profile, zero errors/warnings, all checks, artifact hash) before an
  acceptance criterion is marked met.
- `docs/ARCHIFY.md`, integration notes, and third-party notices for the
  vendored Archify package and its runtime dependencies.
- `.github/` issue and pull-request templates and a `dependabot.yml` for npm,
  pip, and GitHub Actions updates.
- Stable Homebrew tap formula source for `v1.0.0`, validation of AUR `.SRCINFO`,
  and documented maintainer-only publication paths for `stonebridgeway/tap` and
  `ai-dev-system-git`.
- Windows CI job (`windows-latest`): parses every PowerShell script, runs
  `bootstrap.ps1 -Plan`, exercises the client installer's win32 path handling,
  and runs the core unit suite. The Windows install path had no CI coverage
  before.

### Changed

- Package-manager split is now explicit: `packageManager` fields plus a
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` policy section pin `ai-dev-mcp-server/` to npm and
  `frontend-qa/` to pnpm. `resolveSpawnInvocation` no longer silently runs an
  npm command through a bundled pnpm entrypoint — it fails closed instead.
- `npm run docker:audit` now prints a clear "run `npm run docker:prepare` first"
  message when the build context is missing, instead of an `ENOENT` stack trace.
- Minimum Node.js is now 22.12 (was 24). No Node 24-only API is used; `.nvmrc`
  pins `22`, `bootstrap.ps1` accepts 22.12+, and CI adds a Node 22.12 floor job
  (lint + core tests) alongside the Node 24 gate.

### Fixed

- The test suite is isolated from the developer's real `~/.ai-dev` tree: every
  `node --test` run loads `test/setup.mjs`, which pins the `AI_DEV_*` runtime
  roots (task/skill/pilot state, search index, Frontend QA and Archify
  artifacts, model dir) to a throwaway temp directory and exports
  `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`.
- Python helpers (`search_cli.py`, `bge_m3_worker.py`, `bge_m3_embed.py`, the
  UI/UX Pro Max search script) run with `-B`, so `query_ui_ux_knowledge` and
  friends no longer drop `__pycache__/*.pyc` into the checked-in public seed and
  break the next `npm run docker:prepare`.
- `copyDistributionTree` skips forbidden runtime directories (`__pycache__`,
  `.venv`, `node_modules`, …) while copying, so a stray directory left behind by
  a local tool run can no longer fail the Docker context privacy audit.

### Fixed

- Privacy-audit term gathering no longer aborts when `os.userInfo()` throws.
  `ownerUsername()` falls back to `USER` / `USERNAME` / `LOGNAME`, so
  `bootstrap.sh --build-local` (which runs the context scripts inside
  `docker run --user "$uid:$gid"`) works on macOS and on any Linux host whose
  uid is not the image's baked-in `1000`.

### Fixed

- Command policy (`run_quality_gate` / `verify_task` / Frontend QA dev servers)
  now positively allowlists every argument: it rejects code-loading and
  output-redirecting flags (`--require`, `--import`, `--loader`,
  `--test-reporter`, `-c`/`-e`/`-p`, `--config`, `--prefix`/`--dir`/`--cwd`,
  `--output`, `go test -exec`, `cargo test --config`, …), inline Python fused
  with `-c` (`python "-cimport os;…"`), Python scripts referenced by absolute
  path or `..`, package-script "names" that are file paths, and `git diff
  --check` with any flag other than `--cached`/`HEAD`. Executables and path
  operands must resolve inside the project; `validateProjectExecutable` now also
  rejects relative executables (`../../tmp/evil/pytest`), not just absolute ones.

### Fixed

- `path-policy` no longer lets a write pass through a symlink whose target lives
  outside the trusted root: a final-component symlink is `lstat`-checked, and a
  dangling one is rejected with a `PathPolicyError` instead of being treated as
  a new file. The async `resolveWithin` now raises a `PathPolicyError` (not a
  raw `ENOENT`) when a dangling link or a missing path is read.

### Fixed

- Completion evidence is now bound to file *contents*, not just `git status`
  output: `captureProjectState` hashes every dirty/untracked file into the
  fingerprint, so editing an already-dirty file after `verify_task` invalidates
  the evidence. A non-git project directory now gets a real bounded
  `path/size/mtime` fingerprint (strength `medium`) instead of a constant hash
  of its path.
- `complete_task` now honours **only the most recent** verification: it must
  exist, must have passed, and must match the current project fingerprint. A
  later failed run, an edit after the last passing run, or a second completion
  of an already-complete task is refused with a specific message.

### Fixed

- `execFileWithInput` (Frontend QA runner, UI/UX helper) now bounds captured
  output at 16 MiB, kills the whole process group on timeout or overflow so a
  Playwright Chromium or dev server is not orphaned, guards against a
  double-settle, ignores `stdin` `EPIPE`, and decodes stdout/stderr from a
  buffer so multi-byte characters are no longer corrupted at chunk boundaries.

### Fixed

- `ensureSearchIndex` claims the in-flight refresh slot before its first
  `await`, so concurrent search calls join one rebuild instead of each
  starting their own `search_cli.py rebuild` on the same SQLite file. A
  "dirty" reason raised while a rebuild is running is no longer cleared, so
  the next search still rebuilds.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-01

First tagged release.

### Added

- Local `stdio` MCP server (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) exposing repository
  context, a knowledge base, a managed skill library, hybrid search, quality
  gates, Frontend QA, and a verifiable task lifecycle
  (`begin_task` → `checkpoint_task` → `verify_task` → `complete_task`).
- Hybrid search: SQLite FTS, sparse aliases, deterministic intent candidates, and
  an optional local BGE-M3 reranker.
- Public skill seed under `docker/public-seed` (system rules, prompts, quality
  gates, custom workflow skills, MIT-licensed design knowledge).
- Multi-arch Docker image published to GHCR with SBOM and provenance, a hardened
  default runtime (no network, non-root, read-only rootfs, no capabilities), and
  an allowlisted build context that never includes a personal vault.
- Cross-platform bootstrap (`bootstrap.ps1`, `bootstrap.sh`), a fast-start
  launcher / `ClaudeMcpProxy`, Arch `PKGBUILD`, and a Homebrew formula.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`, `docs/RECOVERY.md`; JSDoc types for
  every exported `src/core` function; ~86% line coverage on `src/core`.
- CI: static-quality, security, packaging, and vault-free unit gates (`ci.yml`);
  a `vault-suite` job runs the full vault-coupled test suite plus the protocol and
  lifecycle smokes against the bundled seed; privacy-policy, context-audit,
  image-build, and GHCR publish (`docker-publish.yml`).
- `npm run skills:ensure-index` / `scripts/ensure-skill-index.mjs`: builds the
  bundled seed's skill registry on demand so a standalone checkout can route
  skills.
- English `README.md` (Russian preserved at `README.ru.md`), and root
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and this changelog.
- BGE-M3 weight-download instructions for the source and Docker paths.
- `.nvmrc` pinning Node 24.

### Changed

- Agent-neutral runtime: regenerable data resolves under `~/.ai-dev`
  (`AI_DEV_HOME`) with per-directory `AI_DEV_*` overrides and a `~/.codex`
  fallback for migrated installs. Launchers, helper scripts, the Docker image,
  and the client installer use `node` / `python3` from `PATH`. Documentation and
  the shipped `mcpServers` snippet are client-neutral.
- Vault root resolution: a checkout with no full vault falls back to the bundled
  `docker/public-seed`, so the server and tests work from source without
  `AI_DEV_VAULT_ROOT`. `npm run check` provisions the seed skill registry first,
  so it passes on a fresh clone.

### Fixed

- Vault-coupled tests that require the full production skill catalog or the
  Playwright frontend-qa runner now `skip` when those fixtures are absent instead
  of failing a standalone checkout.
- `buildDockerClientServerConfig` resolves `AI_DEV_PROJECT_PATH` with the path
  API for the requested `platform`, so a Windows client config generated on a
  non-Windows host is no longer mangled; the installer tests pin `platform`
  explicitly instead of relying on `process.platform`.
