/**
 * The README links to the repositories the imported skills came from, and
 * THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md is where those repositories are actually recorded.
 * They were written at different times by different hands, and they drifted:
 * the notices credit `Leonxlnx/taste-skill`, while both READMEs linked
 * `tt-a1i/taste-skill`, which does not exist — a broken link shipped to every
 * reader of the front page (docs/DEFECTS.md, Д-66).
 *
 * So the notices file is the single list of sources, and a GitHub link in a
 * README has to be on it. A link to something that is not a skill source has
 * no place in these files' source paragraphs; if one is ever needed, it goes in
 * the notices too rather than being excused here.
