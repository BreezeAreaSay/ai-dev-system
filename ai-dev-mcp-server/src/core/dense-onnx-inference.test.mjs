/**
 * The one test that needs the weights.
 *
 * Everything else about the ONNX backend is covered against a stub, because a
 * 600 MB download cannot be a precondition of `npm run check`. This is the half
 * a stub cannot answer — that the pinned export, loaded through the real
 * runtime, actually produces a normalized 1024-dimension vector — so it skips
 * with a reason where the model is not installed, and runs in
 * `.github/workflows/dense-eval.yml`, which downloads it first.
 *
 * It is written as the acceptance criterion rather than as a smoke test: the
 * width, the norm, and that two different sentences are not the same vector.
