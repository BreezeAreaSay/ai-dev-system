/**
 * How much room is left where a download is about to write, and whether it

 *
 * The macOS acceptance run filled a disk to about 3 GB free and started the
 * model download: the write rate fell from roughly 45 MB/min to roughly
 * 1 MB/min and nothing said a word (docs/DEFECTS.md, Д-81). From the outside
 * that is the same picture as the stalled CDN of Д-73 — a progress line that
 * barely moves, no error — so the user cannot tell a full disk from a dead
 * source, and the two are fixed by opposite actions.
 *
 * Hence two lines rather than one. Below the first, the download is refused
 * before it starts, with both numbers in the sentence. Above it but inside the
 * second, the download runs and says once that the disk is tight, so slowness
 * that follows has a named cause.
 *
 * `statfs` is a parameter, so both lines are tested without filling a disk.
