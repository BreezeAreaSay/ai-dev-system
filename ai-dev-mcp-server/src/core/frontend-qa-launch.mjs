/**
 * Why the Frontend QA runner never got as far as its own diagnostics.
 *
 * The runner is a separate process with its own dependencies, so the probe that
 * asks it for a status gets, on failure, whatever Node printed to stderr. That
 * text was reduced to its first line, which for a module-resolution failure is
 * the frame Node happens to throw from — `node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:275`
 * — and never the reason. The health check then read `playwright_available:
 * false`, concluded the optional install was skipped, and told the reader to
 * run `npm run setup -- --frontend-qa`.
 *
 * In the published image that advice was wrong twice over: Playwright and
 * Chromium are installed, and the command cannot be run inside the container at
 * all. What had actually happened was that the runner imports two modules from
 * the server by relative path, and in the image the server is not where that
 * path points, so the runner died on its first import (docs/DEFECTS.md, Д-56).
 *
 * Node distinguishes the two cases itself and the wording is stable:
 *
 *   Cannot find package '@axe-core/playwright' imported from …/frontend_qa_runner.mjs
 *   Cannot find module '/opt/ai-dev/ai-dev-mcp-server/src/core/command-policy.mjs' imported from …
 *
 * A package is a dependency nobody installed — the opt-in step, and not a
 * fault. A module is a file that was supposed to be there, which means the
 * install is broken and saying anything softer sends the reader after the wrong
 * thing.
