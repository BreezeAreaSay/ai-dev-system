// Wired in through `node --import ./test/setup.mjs --test …` (see package.json
// and the `check` script). `--import` runs before any test module graph loads,
// so mcp-stdio.mjs resolves its runtime roots — which it does once, at import
// time — against this throwaway directory rather than the developer's own.
//
// Only the explicit `AI_DEV_*` roots are pinned: `aiDevRuntimePath()` honours
// them ahead of the `~/.ai-dev` default, and they cover every path the runtime
// actually writes (task/skill/pilot state, the search index, Frontend QA and
// Archify artifacts, downloaded models). `HOME`/`os.homedir()` is left alone so
// project-boundary detection behaves exactly as it does in production.
