# Knowledge Galaxy

[← README](../README.md) · [Workflow](WORKFLOW.md) · [Capabilities](CAPABILITIES.md) · [Guard rails](GUARDRAILS.md)

Your vault as a galaxy you fly through, in place of Obsidian's graph view.

Obsidian places a note by its links. A note nobody links to has nowhere to go,
so it lands in the outer ring, and in a vault full of generated catalogs that is
most of the vault. The galaxy places notes the way a word2vec galaxy places
words: every note and skill is a star beside its nearest neighbours **in
meaning**. Similar notes form constellations whether or not anyone linked them.
Wikilinks are still there, drawn as warmer lines, so nothing the graph view
showed is lost.

Navigation follows anvaka's [Software Galaxies](https://github.com/anvaka/pm)
(the engine behind the word2vec
[vectorspace](https://github.com/standardgalactic/vectorspace) galaxy): WASD
to fly, mouse to look, the camera kept in the address bar.

## Build it

```bash
cd ai-dev-mcp-server
npm run galaxy                               # every note and skill
node scripts/ai-dev.mjs galaxy knowledge workflows   # only these scopes
```

Or ask your agent to run `render_knowledge_galaxy` (profile `memory`). Either
way the result is one file in the vault:

```
01-system/Knowledge Galaxy.html
```

Open it in any browser with WebGL. It works from disk and offline. Rebuild
whenever the vault has changed: the command brings the search index up to date
first. On the bundled seed (3,291 documents) the whole run takes about eight
seconds.

The tool takes `scopes` (`knowledge`, `skills`, `workflows`, `quality`,
`projects`), `neighbors` (3–24, default 8: more gives denser, rounder
clusters), `obsidian_vault` (the vault name for "Open in Obsidian" links,
default: the vault folder's name) and `seed` (the same vault and seed always
give the same galaxy).

## Flying

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `W` / `S` | forward / back |
| `A` / `D` | left / right |
| `R` / `F` | up / down |
| `Q` / `E` | roll |
| `↑` `↓` `←` `→` | turn |
| `Shift` | four times faster |
| mouse drag | look around |
| wheel | forward / back |
| `Space` | steering mode: the ship turns towards the cursor, no dragging |
| click / double click | select a star / fly to it |
| `L` | links on / off |
| `T` | labels on / off |
| `C` | colour: constellations → note kind → white |
| `+` / `−` | cruising speed |
| `0` / `Home` | overview |
| `/` or `Ctrl+K` | search |
| `Esc` | clear the selection |
| `H` or `?` | the keymap on screen |

The keys are read by their physical position. With a Russian layout active,
`W` is still the key that says `Ц`, and the ship still flies.

On a touch screen: drag to look, hold one finger to fly forward, hold two to fly
back, tap to select.

## What you are looking at

- **A star** is a note, a skill, or a project file the search index holds. A
  skill that has a card note is one star, not two. The index folds the pair
  into one search result, and the galaxy folds it the same way.
- **Its size** is how many neighbours it has. A star that many notes resemble
  is big.
- **A constellation** is a community of the neighbour graph (Louvain
  modularity). Its name is the pair of title words most particular to it.
  That name is computed, not written, so a constellation of brand names may
  have none.
- **Lines**: by default only the short links are drawn, because all of them is a
  hairball. `ml` in the address sets the cut-off. Wikilinks are always drawn,
  in a warm colour. Selecting a star draws all its links and dims the rest.
- **The card** a selected star opens lists its nearest neighbours with their
  similarity, the notes it links to, a preview, and an **Open in Obsidian**
  button.

Positions are a layout, not a measurement. Two stars side by side are similar.
Two stars far apart are only *less* similar, by no particular amount.

## Where the positions come from

The galaxy uses the best vectors the search index has:

- **BGE-M3** vectors, for every document that has one. Build them with
  `npm run setup -- --dense` ([Install](INSTALL.md)).
- The index's **keyword vectors** place the rest, weighted so a word every note
  carries does not pull them all together.

The status bar says which space you are in: `BGE-M3 space`, `keyword space`,
or both. A galaxy built from keyword vectors is useful. One built from BGE-M3
vectors is better: it groups notes by what they mean rather than by the words
they share.

Under that: each document is joined to its eight nearest neighbours. The
search runs in a 96-dimension principal subspace and is re-scored exactly;
on the seed that finds 88% of the true neighbours for a tenth of the exact
search's time. A force layout with the physics of `ngraph.forcelayout` then
settles the result. It starts from the documents' principal coordinates, and
springs between constellations are weaker than springs inside one.

## What the file contains, and what it does not do

The page carries the titles, vault paths and a 240-character preview of every
document it draws. **Sharing the file shares those.**

It makes no request of any kind. It loads no script, font or image from
anywhere, and its Content-Security-Policy (made of the hashes of its own two
inline blocks) would refuse one if it tried. Vault text is written into the
page with `textContent`, never parsed as HTML, so no note title can turn into
markup.

## Limits

- **Time grows with the square of the vault.** Measured on a 2.1 GHz Xeon:
  3,291 documents in 8 s, 10,000 in 30 s, 20,000 in 94 s, nearly all of it
  the neighbour search.
- **One galaxy draws at most 20,000 documents.** Past that, narrow it with
  scopes.
- **Past about 10,000 documents, run it from the command line.** An MCP client
  may give up on the call first: the MCP SDK's default request timeout is
  60 seconds.
- **The viewer needs WebGL.** Without it the page says so rather than showing a
  blank sky.
